BleakHouse

REQUIREMENTS:

A *nix operating system. Windows is not supported.

Gems: 'gruff', 'rmagick', 'active_support', 'RubyInline'

It is highly recommended that you compile the bleak_house patched 
Ruby build. In the plugin directory: 
  rake ruby:build

USAGE:

To profile your application:
  RAILS_ENV=production BLEAK_HOUSE=true ruby-bleak-house ./script/server 
  
Browse around manually, thrash your entire app with a script, 
target troublesome controllers/actions, etc.

Then, to analyze:
  RAILS_ENV=production SMOOTHNESS=1 rake bleak_house:analyze

And then look in log/bleak_house/.

TROUBLESHOOTING

If you see the error "Symbol not found: _rb_gc_heaps_used",
it means you installed the patched binary, but tried to run the 
server with the regular binary.
